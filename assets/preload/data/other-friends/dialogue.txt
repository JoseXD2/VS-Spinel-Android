:dad:I will make this quick and simple for ya, ya snack-sized sucker. I’m looking for Steven Universe. If you tell me where he is, you won’t get pounded into the dirt.

:dad:Hm suit yourself~! I guess you won’t mind if I destroy your planet then?
:bf:C’mon babe you should just let Steven handle this, he actually has gem powers that could stop h--

:dad:Hmmmm… I like those odds, twerp! Let’s go!
